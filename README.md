# DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED
1. *Objective:*
   - To identify open and closed ports on a target machine to assess the potential vulnerabilities in the system.

2. *Steps Performed:*
   - Ran the port_scanner.py script to scan a specific target IP (100.74.110.223) and check commonly used ports such as 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), 
     443 (HTTPS), and 8080 (alternative HTTP).
   - Used Python's socket library to establish TCP connections to the target machine and determine the status of each port.
   - Documented the results of each port status (OPEN or CLOSED) for further analysis.

3. *Purpose of the Task:*
   - To gather information about the target machineâ€™s network services.
   - To identify which ports are open and potentially exposed to unauthorized access.
   - To ensure unused ports are closed, thus reducing the attack surface of the system.

4. *Outcome:*
   - Successfully identified the status of each scanned port.
   - Recommended necessary actions, such as closing unused ports or securing open ones, to strengthen system security.
